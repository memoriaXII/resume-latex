# üìù LaTeX Resume Template

This repository provides a customizable LaTeX template for creating a professional resume. I‚Äôve specially customized the **Experience** and **Education** sections to help you easily format job titles, companies, locations, and employment dates, among other details. The template includes the following sections:
- Experience
- Education
- Leadership & Activities
- Skills

Feel free to personalize the template to highlight your career achievements, education, and skills. You can easily adapt the layout and content to suit your unique profile.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LilG-Cheng-Ju/PerfectResume-Latex.git
    ```

2. Modify the `resume.tex` file to fit your own experiences, skills, and education.

3. Compile the LaTeX file to generate your PDF resume. You can use an editor like Overleaf or a local LaTeX distribution to do this.
